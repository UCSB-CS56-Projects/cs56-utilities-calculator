a) Our project is a simple, 4-function calculator that evaluates an algebraic expression. It can interpret exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.

b) As a user, I can do multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction between 2 numbers so that I can evaluate an algebraic expression.
   As a user, I can click the clear button so that I can evaluate another algebraic expression.
   As a user, I can click the delete button so that I can erase the most recent input.

c) Yes, the software runs. It works as a simple calulator that the user can use to evaluate basic algebraic expressions.

d) As a programmer, I can implement a fraction button so that the answer can be given in simplified fraction form. 
   As a programmer, I can implement a different color scheme so that the calculator is more appealing to look at.
   As a programmer, I can implement the ability to do evalulate an algebraic expression using the current answer on the screen so that I can have continuous calculations.
   As a programmer, I can implement trigonometric functions into the calculator so that the user can evaluate basic trigonometry.

e) The README.md file seems solid and helpful when one is figuring out how to use the program. They could have been more specific about what each of the files of code does.

f) Ant; no, there are no targets that need descriptions.

g) Yes, there are more than enough issues that can earn us 1000 points. Yes, most of the issues seem to be clear in what they are asking for.

h) We have not added any code as of yet so there are no additional issues.

i) The code is organized to read through a user-inputted string (derived from the GUI of a keypad), looking at parentheses, decimal points, and different operators. Yes, the purposes of the classes and their methods are clear. Calculator.java and Keypad.java are more or less the primary classes, with Calculator doing most of the work. Yes, it is obvious how the two classes relate. The code is difficult to understand with certain methods, but it is otherwise clear. We would convey the append() method and the evaluate() method. 

j) The software does compile. There appears to be plenty of JUnit tests in the CalculatorTest.java file, it lookes like one for each operator. However, all of the tests are commented out, and when they are uncommented and we try to compile we seem to get a repeating error for each test. It seems like most of the test cases have been take into account, as there are not that many functions with this calulator.
